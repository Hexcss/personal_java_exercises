# Exercise: Guess the Number Game

## Objective

Write a program where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range.

## Task: 

The program generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user is then asked to guess the number. After each guess, the program should give a hint whether the guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number. Once guessed, the program outputs the number of attempts the user took to guess the number.

## Requirements:

- Use a while loop to keep the game going until the correct guess is made.
- Ensure the user is given feedback on each guess.
- Use the Math.random() function to generate a random number.

## Sample Output:

```
Guess a number between 1 and 100: 50
Too low! Guess again: 75
Too high! Guess again: 60
Correct! It took you 3 guesses.
```
