# Exercise: Simple Grade Classifier

## Objective: 
Write a program that classifies a student's grade based on a score input.

## Task: 
Ask the user for their score (0 to 100), then print out the grade they have achieved based on the following scale:

- A: 90-100
- B: 80-89
- C: 70-79
- D: 60-69
- F: Less than 60
  
## Requirements:

- If the score is above 100 or below 0, the program should print an error message indicating an invalid score.
- Use if, else if, and else statements to handle all the conditions.

## Sample Output:

```
Enter your score: 85
Your grade is B.
```

Or, if invalid score entered:

```
Enter your score: 105
Invalid score entered.
```
