# Exercise: Discount Calculation

## Objective
Write a program that applies a discount to a purchase based on the purchase amount using a ternary operator.

## Task
Ask the user for the total purchase amount. If the amount is greater than or equal to $100, they get a 10% discount. Otherwise, they get a 5% discount. The program should calculate and display the final price after the discount.

## Requirements
- Use a single ternary operator to determine the discount rate.
- Calculate the discount and final price using the determined discount rate.
- Print out the original price, the discount rate applied, and the final price.

## Sample Output

```
Enter the total purchase amount: $150
Original Price: $150.00
Discount Rate: 10%
Final Price: $135.00
```

Or, for a purchase amount less than $100:

```
Enter the total purchase amount: $50
Original Price: $50.00
Discount Rate: 5%
Final Price: $47.50
```
