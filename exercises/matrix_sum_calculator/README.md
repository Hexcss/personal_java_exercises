# Exercise: Matrix Sum Calculator

## Objective
Write a program that creates a 3x3 matrix, fills it with user input, and calculates the sum of all the elements in the matrix.

## Task 
Ask the user to input values for a 3x3 matrix (which is 3 rows by 3 columns). Once the matrix is filled, compute and print the sum of all the numbers in the matrix.

## Requirements

- Define a 3x3 matrix (2D array) to store integers.
- Use nested loops to prompt the user for input to fill the matrix.
- After filling the matrix, use nested loops to sum the values.
- Display the sum to the user.

## Sample Output

```
Enter the number for row 1, column 1: 1
Enter the number for row 1, column 2: 2
Enter the number for row 1, column 3: 3
Enter the number for row 2, column 1: 4
Enter the number for row 2, column 2: 5
Enter the number for row 2, column 3: 6
Enter the number for row 3, column 1: 7
Enter the number for row 3, column 2: 8
Enter the number for row 3, column 3: 9

Sum of all the elements: 45
